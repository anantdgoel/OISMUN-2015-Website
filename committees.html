      <h4>Vasundhra Aggarwal</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">In the early years of adolescence, adorned in my ballet flats and awkwardly-fitted dress, I recall my first MUN experience, where I was entrusted with the oh-so-paramount task of delivering notes for the delegates. Clearly, I’ve come a long way since then. While playing grown-up was exciting, it was more than just parading around - it was being given the platform to understand and resolve global issues, that even degree-clad adults cannot achieve. 

As a theater aficionado, I encourage you, the delegates, not to recite mere facts, but embody your role as an advocate of your country. While authentic research is a must, making inferences on your country’s stance will enable you to genuinely participate. Take risks by rebutting, responding, retaliating - improvise if you need to! No MUN is fun without engaging in at least one heated altercation. 

At MUN, we think, outside we do. Taking a step further, I aim to tackle one issue at a time, by participating in several philanthropic organizations to support education, a green environment, women empowerment, eradicate disease and homelessness. Other than that, I intend on trying every restaurant during my time here in Mumbai, draw people (not in a creepy way, I swear), and exhaust my time watching an unhealthy amount of Impractical Jokers. I, Vasundhra Aggarwal, along with Zubin Israni, my annoying friend/classmate/nuisance, look forward to seeing you in the GA! </p>

      <h4>Zubin Israni</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">My name's Zubin Israni. I've been MUNing since I could ride a bike. Well not exactly, life ain't that sad. I've had four years of experience during which I've been awarded numerous delegate awards at several conferences. I attended the Harvard MUN conference 2013 which I'm only writing cuz it looks real good on my profile (gloat). I game quite a bit. My favourite titles include The last of Us, Uncharted, Arkham and FIFA- which is an obvious one for any testosterone filled body. I appreciate art in the form of media- watch pretty much every movie, TV-series. My favourite comedian's are Chris Rock and Kevin Hart. I believe MUN's a great opportunity for personal development but it ain't worth it if you're gonna sit there clueless like Snoop dog at a NASA conference. I'm a pretty chill guy so you can tell me anything you want as long as it's not about my eyebrows or resemblance to Louis Litt.</p>

My name is Avvalzameer Bhatia, but everyone has always just called me Avval. It is my utmost honour to be chairing the Security Council, along with my friend and an extremely experienced MUNer, Ronak Upadhyaya.  Economics and history happen to be my favourite subjects, and also happen to be the reason why I started MUNing in the first place. I am also the Vice – President of the Student Council at Oberoi International School. Since the Security Council is the most prestigious committee in the United Nations, we expect well - researched delegates and high quality debate. We also expect delegates to be well - versed with the HMUN procedures. However, we also want your MUN experience to be enjoyable. Hence, sign up for the Security Council if you’re prepared for some challenging, yet constructive debate, and a lot of fun!  </p>

      <h4>Ronak Upadhyaya</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">Hello everybody.<br> I am Ronak Upadhyaya, and I am looking forward to serving as your chair for the Security Council of OISMUN III. To me, Model UN truly represents the most deliberate and up-front means of developing crucial communications skills and understanding the art of negotiation.
<br>
My interest in diplomacy and foreign affairs generated curiosity, and thus began my MUNning career. The idea of solving global issues itself gave me an adrenaline rush, and since then I have come a long way, having been to many MUNs across India and also overseas, enriching my debating and discussing skills along my 5 year long MUN journey. I started MUNing as a member of the Economic and Social Council in 2012 with EMUN. After another 2 stints in the specialize committees, I participated in HMUN 2013 as a representative of my school and as a member of the General Assembly. It was only after this that my experience with emergency committees like the Security Council really began.
<br>
I have been part of the OIS since last year and am currently pursuing IBDP. Apart from being engrossed in books, I am a passionate FIFA and GTA gamer. I am a devoted Arsenal fan who not only watches, but also plays football regularly. 
<br>
With greater time spent experiencing Model UN comes greater appreciation, I will do my part to ensure that the SC committee is productive and engaging. As delegates, you all are highly encouraged to remain enthusiastic throughout your time invested towards OISMUN III, from researching to committee session. As the Chair I expect high caliber delegates, and a high quality of debate: nothing less will suffice. It’s the toughest and the most pertinent committee in the United Nations. 
<br>
Menacing issues grip the world today, with crime rates and mortalities rising at an alarming rate. These problems require new ways of thinking and even better ideas. To conclude, I would like to quote John F Kennedy, “A man may die, nations may rise and fall, but an idea lives on.” Let your ideas make the world a better place. </p>

      <h4>Smiti Modi</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">Hello! <br>

My name is Smiti Modi and I am a Grade 12 IBDP student at Oberoi International 

School. Debating and discussing international issues, especially those pertaining to 

human rights, has always been a passion of mine and Model UN has really given me 

an opportunity to do just that. Besides MUN, I have a deep love for Harry Potter 

(reading in general actually), art and travel. 
<br>
The Human Right Council is easily one of the most important committees as it aims 

to secure equal rights and justice for all, which is one of the most difficult and 

perilous tasks to accomplish. All around the world, suffering goes unheard as various 

groups have their basic human rights violated time and again. There can be no scope 

for development and stability if these rights are not granted freely and equally to 

everyone, barring religion, nationality, ethnicity or gender.
<br>
When applying to the HRC, delegates should make sure that their voice is heard and 

yet be willing to compromise and come up with a strong resolution. I expect to 

witness fascinating, thought-provoking debates and meet enthusiastic, well-

prepared delegates. I also hope to put my past experience with various MUNs to 

good use and help move debate forward. If you have any queries or concerns, please 

do not hesitate to get in touch.<br> Good Luck!</p>

      <h4>Aish Sandeep</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">It is my pleasure to welcome you to OISMUN 2015; <br> I am Aish Sandeep a grade 11 student 

pursuing the IBDP. My MUN journey started when I was in the 8th grade, my first MUN being 

VHMUN. After that my life was never the same, I got so addicted to the concept that I 

attended 6 more MUNs and won awards in every single one of them. Apart from MUNing my 

hobbies include playing the guitar, bass guitar and drums. I love squash and football and 

spend a lot of my time playing these sports. More than any of these I love anime and can't 

spend a day without it.
<br>
I expect active participation, heated altercations as well as comprehensive, viable and 

unique solutions. I am looking forward to this MUN, as it will be my first time chairing. I will 

do my best make this MUN the best one you have been to. If you have any queries please 

feel free to approach me. Will see you in committee. </p>

      <h4>Yash Shetty</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">Hello Delegates, <br>
My name is Yash Shetty and I will be your Chair for SPECPOL in the 3rd edition of the OIS MUN. MUN’s were something that I wasn’t really interested until I attended my first MUN -  the ‘All World Summit’ at Jamnabai Narsee School. The exhilarating, heated debates fascinated me and ever since, I wanted to keep going back to MUNs. The thrill in participating in those intense debates, in thrashing out the terms of groundbreaking resolutions with my allies and in constantly trying and get an edge over my rivals by hook or by crook, never really faded out for me. Even though MUN’s are just a simulation, you always feel so engaged with the issues that you can’t tell yourself apart from a real world leader. That’s what MUN does to you!
<br>
I invite all of you to be part of SPECPOL this year and I promise you that with our intriguing topics - which involve  border crisis and burning political issues - and committed chairs, SPECPOL will be the best across all committees at OIS MUN this year! (expect fireworks……….in the literal sense)
<br>
MUN’s aside, I am a passionate football lover, Chelsea Football Club being my favourite team(KTBFFH)! I also play football myself at MDFA 3rd Division level for ,’Steadfast Rush Soccer Club’ . FIFA sessions, often extending into the early hours of the morning,  and playing the guitar are amongst my other hobbies.
<br>
Hope to see you all at SPECPOL.
<br>
Alert: Choose your committee wisely!

      <h4>Aryaman Pandya</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">The reason I initially started participating in model united nations conferences is because I was a stubborn child who loved arguing. What started off as a mere pass-time has now come a long way from there.  MUN is much more than that to me now. The concept of a model united nations conference now serves as a platform through which I can learn from, relate to and speak against several different global perspectives. 
<br>
MUN helped build my confidence, both as a speaker and as a person in general, and I doubt I’m the only one who can say that. 
<br>
At this year’s OIS MUN, I will be chairing the Special Political and Decolonisation Committee, along with my co chair Yash Shetty. I’m not a person who tends to be very serious during conferences, and can assure you that my committee will not be limited to boring debate. However, this does not mean that nonsense will be tolerated during discussions, because time is precious. 
<br>
I’m also a national level squash player. That should be more than enough information about me. Hope to see you soon.

      <h4>Aayush Asthana</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">Welcome to the DISEC Delegates, I am Aayush Asthana, and I am going to be your Chair for this year’s OIS MUN. MUN had started off as something my parents made me try out and before I knew it, it became a passion. I have been an avid MUN-er since the 8th grade and from my experience, even though you don’t get to talk a lot in some MUNs, the interactions with other delegates and the experiences you gain from them are priceless. The joy of knowing that I have the ability to solve some of the major issues around the world, even if it is just for two days, is simply exhilarating. Personally, I’m particularly interested in war situations; all of the committees and MUNs I have excelled in the past have been on such topics. I believe that a good delegate needs to know their information from the back of their hand. Not only information pertaining to their own country but also facts about most of the others in the committee. Good delegates should also have excellent problem solving skills, in order to get their nations out of the most dire straits when presented with a crisis.
<br>
I have been part of the OIS since Grade 11 in the IBDP programme. My favorite subjects are Maths and Chemistry; no matter how long I study them, I just never get bored. Apart from being into the books most of the time I am an avid Call of Duty and FIFA gamer. I love experimenting with food all the time and I am not that bad a cook myself. I am a passionate Manchester United fan and was part of the interschool football team last year.  I am neither an optimist nor a pessimist,I am a realist who looks at the world as it is and does not like sugar coating anything.
<br>
I am excited to meet all of you delegates along with my co-chair Saiba Ahuja and we both await quality debate by you all. Cheers. 
<br>
I’d just like to leave you with this, “Your Chairs have the X –Factor, do you?”

      <h4>Saiba Ahuja</h4>
      <p class="flow-text">Apart from being the occasional journalist and the perpetual gastronome, I take great pride in my 

role as a keen participator in Model UN Conferences. I believe delegates must be well researched 

and must have a fire in their hearts to step up their game and give it their best shot. This being my 

second experience with the Oberoi International MUN, I can confidently assure you all that the 

level of debate is not one worth underestimating. Together, we can join hands and work together to 

help save our world - currently on the brink of incessant conflict. 
<br>
Adhering to my idea of using #nofilter in real life, I would like to introduce myself as the risk taking 

introvert who loves trying her luck with previously unexplored endeavours. I view myself as a 

headstrong 17 year old ready to take on the world, but just one day at a time. This is my eighth UN 

conference, making me experienced enough to present myself as a member of the Executive 

Board. 
<br>
DISEC is a committee that requires vigour, determination and the power of persuasion and rational 

thinking. While addressing a worldwide crisis, it is of utmost importance that a delegate always 

keeps in mind their main cause and focus. 

Delegates, I am your chair, Saiba Ahuja and I look forward to another zealous debate in DISEC 

this year, along with my co-chair Aayush Asthana.
